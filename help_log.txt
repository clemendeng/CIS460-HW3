Office hours:
9/21 3:00-4:30: questions on RenderScene() - how to draw, how the scene is displayed, bugs
9/23 1:00-2:30: problem with debugger and rendering the scene with "scenes -> equilateral triangle" (works properly) vs. "file -> load scene -> {some scene}" (only loads the background, debugging this case doesn't work)
9/24 4:30-5:30: previous issue resolved - issue with triangulate
9/25 2:30-3:00: 3D rendering clarifications - normalize to 512x512, process of transforming to 3D
9/26 4:30-5:30: rendering too large - change radians to degrees; rendering out of bounds - problem with line intersections (if y < a.y, b.y or y > a.y, b.y)
